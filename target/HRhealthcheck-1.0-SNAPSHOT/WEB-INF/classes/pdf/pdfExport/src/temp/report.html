        <h3> Legal Compliance</h3>
        <div class="content">
<p>
A <b>failure</b> to pay attention to measuring compliance can lead to a company not only falling foul of regulators, but also facing fines, censures, reputational damage and even, in some instances, the prospect of jail time for directors.
<br>
</p>

<p>
Compliance requirements differ by jurisdiction, making evaluating legal compliance a difficult and sizeable responsibility for entity managers?tasked with its tracking.
<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>suggestion:<br>How to ensure you're fully legally compliant
</p>

<p>
A business' state of compliance can be evaluated at two levels:
</p>

<p>
Compliance with the external rules imposed upon the business as a whole by Government or industry body regulations, including compliance with laws or ethical standards; and?Compliance with the internal systems of control imposed by the business to help it achieve compliance with those externally imposed rules.
</p>

<p>
Robust legal compliance requires easy and quick access to up-to-date, real-time data; measuring using old or incorrect data can actually cause compliance to slip, which can have a long-lasting financial and reputational impact on an entity or larger group of entities.
</p>

<p>
Technology's role in legal compliance
</p>

<p>
Entity management software has emerged as a solution to getting and storing essential data.
</p>

<p>
The main objective of legal entity management software is to store and maintain all subsidiary-related information to establish a single source of truth for all entity-related information. It allows for the implementation of processes and procedures across all global entities to ensure precision, accuracy and timeliness with your compliance program.

<p>
Employees not specifically exempt from the overtime provisions of the FLSA are considered non-exempt (hourly) employees by UNL and are eligible for overtime compensation. Employees should not be scheduled for overtime work without the appropriate departmental authorization.
</p>

<p>
Abuse of flextime scheduling may result in loss of the privilege.
</p>

<p>
Occasions may arise when flextime must be suspended temporarily because of departmental work load, vacations, or other reasons. When this occurs, the department should give employees as much advance notice as possible.
</p>

<p>
Adequate supervision must be provided for employees on flextime. However, this does not require that supervisors be present during all hours worked by employees. Supervision can frequently be exercised by measuring productivity.

If it’s because they need to make a decision, say that too, but communicate clearly what they should do. Organizations that want to make their benefit communications more successful must put a clear strategy in place. This should set out what messages need to be communicated and how the information will be shared. It should also consider any obstacles to overcome, and the desired objectives and employee actions.</p>
