<p>Benefits communication is often focused solely on being compliant, with less thought about the person at the other end. Avoid jargon. Keep sentences short. And always make it clear what employees need to do with the communication they are receiving. If it’s just for their information, say that. If it’s because they need to make a decision, say that too, but communicate clearly what they should do. Organizations that want to make their benefit communications more successful must put a clear strategy in place. This should set out what messages need to be communicated and how the information will be shared. It should also consider any obstacles to overcome, and the desired objectives and employee actions.</p>
