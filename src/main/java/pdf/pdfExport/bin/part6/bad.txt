Employee recruitment and retention are major challenges that many employers and HR teams struggle with.?For instance, these days employees are increasingly demanding a more balanced work life and aren¡¯t willing to sacrifice everything for their careers. Lifelong employment with one organization is no longer the core desire. Instead, they¡¯d rather continue to search for the?best pay, benefits, and culture & work environment.no one is going to want to join an organization when they have no idea how any of its internal processes work.??In addition, those managers must communicate frequently with their staff, to build a positive working relationship and share necessary information.
