<p>You should take stock of policies?</p>

<p>
All legal compliance policies that you put in place need to be closely adhered to and remain up to date. While evaluating legal compliance, check that your policies are still fit for purpose. Have there been changes in the business or in the industry that need to be reflected in any updated policies? Are your people aware of and working within the policies? These are important questions to frequently ask; an annual review is essential to successfully evaluating legal compliance, supported by regular spot checks.
