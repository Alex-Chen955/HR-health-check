<b>suggestion:<br>How to ensure you're fully legally compliant
</p>

<p>
A business' state of compliance can be evaluated at two levels:
</p>

<p>
Compliance with the external rules imposed upon the business as a whole by Government or industry body regulations, including compliance with laws or ethical standards; and?Compliance with the internal systems of control imposed by the business to help it achieve compliance with those externally imposed rules.
</p>

<p>
Robust legal compliance requires easy and quick access to up-to-date, real-time data; measuring using old or incorrect data can actually cause compliance to slip, which can have a long-lasting financial and reputational impact on an entity or larger group of entities.
